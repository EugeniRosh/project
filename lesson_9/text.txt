Data and privacy
Controversial voice-activated dolls have shown some of the risks of connected toys - insecure Bluetooth connections led to children’s conversations being recorded and the toys could even be hacked.

So how do Lego deal with these issues?

"For the last few years, we have developed and created connected toys, so we have a set of established safety and compliance processes," explained Tim Taylor-Bowden, the Lead Technology Architect at LEGO Group.

"LEGO has a priority focus on safety for kids, on privacy, so by default we have a lot of practices which make our products safe before we even understand and consider the legislation. For example, our connected toys currently do not collect any data from the users."
